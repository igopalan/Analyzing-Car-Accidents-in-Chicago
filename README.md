# Analyzing-Car-Accidents-in-Chicago
Using the Chicago Data Portal https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if, I analyzed 358,000 vehicle accidents from 2015 - 2019, and built models to help predict if an accident would be considered "Costly" (over $1,500 in damage) or not.
